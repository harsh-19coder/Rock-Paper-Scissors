# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an interactive and engaging web application that simulates the classic hand game. The project leverages HTML for structuring the game interface, CSS for styling and enhancing the visual appeal, and JavaScript for implementing the game logic and interactivity. Users can select between rock, paper, and scissors, and the computer makes a random choice. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design, providing an excellent learning experience in front-end development.
